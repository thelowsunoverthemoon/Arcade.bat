## üêç Snake üêç
There's been Snake done in pure Batch already [here](https://www.dostips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4741) by dbenham, but I wanted to make a version that was as simple and minimal as possible. I also wanted to make a version that relied solely on VT100 escape sequences for display.

The following version of Snake in Batch is very simple, and it has non-blocking controls, pellets, ect, everything in a classic Snake game. Also, I made it so that moving in the opposite direction results in a collision, just for that extra challenge. It also has 3 "skins" you can choose from just for fun. To play, just save it in a .bat file and run. You MUST save it in UTF-8 format, or else the Unicode characters show. You can also change up the Snake Speed, but editing the snake[speed] variable. (lower number -> faster)

## üü° Pacman üü°
I did simplify a lot of the rules, but the basic game is there. Here are the major changes:

* No "ghost house"; eaten ghosts reset all at once after the powerup wears off
* Ghosts turn white after eating powerup, and turn dark blue to signal the powerup is wearing off
* Ghosts all have the same basic behavior
* No fruits

Due to the method of input used, the controls lag/miss keys sometimes. As well, it's pretty much impossible to win unless you manually adjust the speed variable to a really high number, so I didn't bother implementing a win detection. It's more of a proof of concept than anything.

The script also adjusts reg keys to use Lucida Console font instead of the default Consolas, to give it a more retro feel. If you don't want that, then just replace the first IF with

```Batch
IF not "%1" == "" (
    GOTO :%1
)
```
You MUST save it in UTF-8 encoding for the characters to display properly, and also have Windows 10 for VT100 sequences. Use WASD to move.

## üê¶ Flappy Bird üê¶
Depending on your computer, it may be faster or slower, but you can always change the values in the %every% macro to make it faster or slower ("every" N frame do this, so every 2 frames is faster than every 3 frames). I was too lazy to do any frame capping, but I did add some clouds and randomized bird colours just to keep it faithful to the original.

## ü¶ñ Google Dinosaur Game ü¶ñ
The script has randomized cactus and the day & night mode shift from the original game. And when you're saving it into a script, save it in ANSI encoding, or the Unicode characters won't display right. Here are some screenshots of the game.
